## Description

Log in, share your latest project build, an amazing find at a show or on the street. Snap it and share it for the MotoShare community to see. 

## Getting Started

### Development

Using Trello to track and layout everything I needed to get done, I started off the project with wireframing a targeted outcome. Being the first back end and CRUD web app I have worked on I wanted to keep the flow simple and the style clean.

Building the severside of the app took a bit longer than expected coming across more bugs than expected, thankfully nothing major, routing issue and the odd typo here and there.

The styling of the app took up a good chunk of time, whilst still getting the hang of CSS getting it to a place where it looked clean and stylish to longer than I had hoped for. Lots of interations and tweaks to get things where they should be and lookig nice, removing features and replacing with others etc. An issue that I would still like to improve on is the images on the home page and the sizing as the window changes. Overall, happy with the look in the time frame of the build but few additions would be nice to meet the design made in the wireframing process.

A few things still in progress, categories and brand in the nav bar need a job to do and currently are defunct which I would like to get sorted. 


### Technologies Used

- Javascript
- node.js
- Express.js
- HTML/EJS
- CSS
- Postgres

### Desired Extra Features

There is a few extra things I would have to have added in and currently working on.

- I began working on comments page which you can see at /comments. The plan is to intergrate this in to the page that displays the single using the data base.
- Sort the categories feature
- Like button
- Share button
- Upload and image to the cloud instead of URL
